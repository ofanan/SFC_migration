## Service Function Chains Migration

This project provides simulator tools to test scenarios and algorithms for the migration of Service Function Chains (SFC). 

# Mobility simulator

The algorithms decide on migration based on input files that are generated by a mobility simulator. The file mobility_simulator.py implements a simple event-driven simulator. The simulator simulates users moving within a rectangle, that is covered by several Access Points (APs). 

Each user moves randomly, either horizontally or vertically, where the destination point is picked u.a.r. in a way that verifies that it is always within another quarter of the rectangle. Each user arriving to its destination immediately starts moving to another destination, at the same way described above.

# Mobility simulator output files
By default, output files are written to a sibling directory named "../res". If you don't have, please generate such a directory. 

Whenever a user crosses to another quarter, the simulator prints to a file the time, and the number of the quarter currently covering each user. The number of the quarter may be interpreted as an Access Point (AP) that covers this quarter, and therefore the extension of this output file is ".ap". 

In addition, once in a second, the simulator outputs to a file with the extension ".loc" the current location (by means of X,Y coordinates) of all the users. This output format allows a larger time for migrations to finish before deciding on new migrations. In addition, it allows for simulating more then 4 APs (see below). 

# Mobility simulator input files
The main simulator, implemented mainly in the file SFC_mig_simulator.py, knows how to parse both ".ap" files; and ".loc" files. 

When SFC_mig_simulator reads an ".ap" file, it uses the AP hard-coded in that file.
When SFC_mig_simulator reads a ".loc" file, it calculates the AP covering the current location of each user, where the number of APs is a parameter, that may be larger than 4.
