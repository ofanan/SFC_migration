## Service Function Chains Migration

This project simulates deployment and migration of Service Function Chains (SFC) in data-centers.
The projects includes:
- Parsing of real-world antenna location files.
- Simulating users mobility of using SUMO.
- Implementation of a provably-optimal CPU allocation algorithm.
- Implementation of several greedy VM placement algorithm, as well as a Linear-Program relaxation for the VM placement problem (which is NP-hard).
- A wide range of statistics and performance analysis tools.

More details would be provided once an academic paper is accepted for publication. Stay tuned.
