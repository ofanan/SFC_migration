## Service Function Chains Migration

This project provides simulator tools to test scenarios and algorithms for the migration of Service Function Chains (SFC). 

# Mobility simulator

The algorithms decide on migration based on input files that are generated by a mobility simulator. The file mobility_simulator.py implements a simple event-driven simulator. The simulator simulates users moving within a rectangle, that is covered by several Access Points (APs). Each user moves randomly, either horizontally or vertically, where the destination point is picked u.a.r. in a way that verifies that it is always within another quarter of the rectangle. Each user arriving to its destination immediately starts moving to another destination, at the same way described above.

# Output files
By default, output files are written to a sibling directory named "../res". If you don't have, please generate such a directory. Whenever a user crosses to another quarter, the simulator prints to a file the time, and the number of the quarter currently covering each user. The number of the quarter may be interpreted as an Access Point (AP) that covers this quarter, and therefore the extension of this output file is ".ap". In addition, once in a second, the simulator outputs to a file with the extension ".loc" (for "location"), the current lcoation (that is, (X,Y) coordinates) of all the users. This output is meant to allow enlarging the number of AP.

The main simulator, implemented mainly in the file SFC_mig_simulator.py, knows how to parse both ".ap" files; and ".loc" files. In particular, when SFC_mig_simulator reads a ".loc" file, it assumes that the number of APs ia a square of a natural number, so that there are X*X APs in a grid. Using this assumption, SFC_mig_simulator assigns each user to an AP.
