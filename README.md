## Service Function Chains Migration

This project simulates deployment and migration of Service Function Chains (SFC) in data-centers.
The projects includes:
- Parsing of real-world antenna location files. 
- Simulating users mobility of using SUMO.
- Implementation of a provably-optimal CPU allocation algorithm.
- Implementation of several greedy VM placement algorithm, as well as a Linear-Program relaxation for the VM placement problem (which is NP-hard).
- A wide range of statistics and performance analysis tools.

# Overview of the python code files

##### run_Traci.py #
Runs a Traci SUMO simulation, and generates .loc files. The .loc file details the location of each vehicle at each time period. 
It is also possible to run the simulation for collecting general statistics, such as the total number of distinct vehicles within the simulated area, or the average speed, during a given time period.

##### loc2poa_c.py #
Take a .loc file, generated by run_Traci.py, and generate from it a .poa file, which details the association of vehicles to PoAs (points-of-access) at each time slot. It is possible to assume either an arbitrary iterative partitioning of the simulated areas into quadrants (that is, having in total 4^k cells, for some positive integer k); or use the real-world data of antennas locations.
It is also possible to calculate statistics, such as the average number of vehicles in each cell.

##### SFC_mig_simulator.py #
A simulator that reads a .poa file line-by-line; allocates to each user the minimal CPU it needs for being successfully served within its time constraints; and and runs either a placement algorithm, or an ILP optimization tool, for finding a minimal-cost feasible placement of all the chains.
The typical output of the simulation is a .res file, containing data about the status of the solution (fail/sccs), its cost, the overall number of users, the number of critical users (users whose chains must be migrated), etc.

##### Res_file_parser.py #
Gets as input the output of a simulation run by SFC_mig_simulator.py (typically, a .res file), and generates from it either .pcl files to store all the data in a memory-efficient way, plots, or tables.

# Additional required input files
To run a SUMO simulation, you need also the relevant configuration files. Here are the configuration files for [LuST](https://github.com/lcodeca/LuSTScenario) (Luxembourg Sumo Traffic project), and for [MoST](https://github.com/lcodeca/MoSTScenario) (Monaco Sumo Traffic project).
